CAD Viewer

Simple CAD files viewer. Using OpenCASCADE for data model and Open Inventor for rendering.
OpenCASCADE rendering also supported but doesn't work because of bug in OpenCASCADE 6.5.
Supports data formats:
 - BREP
 - CSFDB
 - IGES (Because of bug in OpenCASCADE 6.5 opening files of this format lead to program crash)
 - STEP
